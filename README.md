# Minecraft faction bot server
The backend part of a bot that i used on many factions and skyblock servers, this thing can use quite some cpu but runs fine on a hetzner or ovh vps.
This was never built to be opensource so the code can be quite messy

Things to do yourself:
- accounts.json 
- user.htpasswd
